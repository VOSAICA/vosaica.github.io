{"pages":[],"posts":[{"title":"IIDX_DIY","text":"1. IntroThis repo includes CAD files and arduino scripts to help you build your own IIDX controller with relatively low budget. You can access my repository at my Github page: IIDX-DIY For the case of the controllerThe case is build with acrylic. You will need to find a factory and provide them with the CAD files. After getting them all cutted, you can glue them together. Some parts will also need screws to be assembled, you need to buy them in stores. For the circuit of the controllerWe are using arduino as the basic control device here. For my own controller, I am using the arduino micro, but of course you can choose other type of arduino, but to ensure they have enough ports. For building the complete circuit, the basic tools you will need are wires, soldering tin, and electric soldering iron. Besides, the bottons for the controller, the connection cables will also be needed. Since you could hardly find an excactly same type of the botton with the IIDX arcade, I will recommend you to search arcade botton on AliExpress. The encoder is also needed for the rotating part. 2. Let’s begin!!!Building the caseAfter you have get the cutted acrylic, you can assemble them according to the diagram below. notice that there are special glue for acrylic, it can dissolve the acrylic so the case would be in better quality. The bottom plank of the case should not be glued, be careful. The extra hole on the top panel of the box is for moving the disk futher to attain the arcade distance standard. And for you can moving the disk anytime you want, you should use metal columns and glue to assemble the support for the disk. Building the circuitThe circuit part is based on arduino. 1 encoder, 9 bottons, wires, and a long microUSB cable are needed. Though you can use different model of arduino, I recommend you to use the arduino micro, since it could be powered directly by the microUSB port. For the wiring, I soldered my arduino on a board with holes and use wire to prolong the position of connecting the bottons.For 9 bottons, I used 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 16 port on arduino. The encoder used 2 and 3 It’s necessary for encoder to use the 2 and 3 ports for special function. Do not change them And you will have to give all the bottons a common ground, which is GND port on arduino and encoder a 5V and GND.","link":"/2020/07/12/IIDX_DIY/"},{"title":"my-first-post","text":"为什么爷要写博客？ 说真的，为什么呢？我也不知道 估计过不了多久就不写了，毕竟也没什么写的 2020.7.8","link":"/2020/07/08/my-first-post/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
